# zig-demo

Run [Zig](https://ziglang.org) programs on the Oasis platform using WASI!

This demo will greet the sender and return a random number.
It assumes that you have a web3 gateway running at `localhost:8546`.
You can use [oasis-chain](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-chain) for that.

Just run `make` to do the thing!

## Example

```
$ make
Hi b8b3666d8fea887d97ab54f571b8e5020c5c8b58! Your number is 42.
```
